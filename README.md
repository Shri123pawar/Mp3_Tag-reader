# Mp3_Tag-reader
The MP3 Tag Reader project in C is a software which will read and display MP3 (ID3) tag information from MP3 files. The software will be desktop based and not web based. The project will be useful to individuals who wish to view and collect MP3 tag data. This project can be extended to implement a tag editor, wherein users can modify mp3 tag information.

Implemented as a command line application, this should be able to handle some operations on the MP3 tags as called out below.
